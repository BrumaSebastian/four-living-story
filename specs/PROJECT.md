# Project

## Overview
FourLivingStory is a gamified personal productivity tracker styled after the 4Story MMORPG game.
Users manage real-life responsibilities — daily habits, personal tasks, and expense tracking — and are rewarded with in-game character progression: XP, gold, item drops, and equipment upgrades.

The core loop: **do real-life things → earn rewards → level up your character → unlock better gear**.

## Goals
- Make personal productivity engaging by tying it to character progression
- Track daily habits, one-off personal tasks, and expense management in one place
- Reward consistency and completion with visible, meaningful in-game progress
- Deliver an immersive 4Story-themed UI (fantasy MMORPG aesthetic)

## Non-Goals
- Not a multiplayer game — single-user, personal tracker only
- Not a full game engine — character stats are cosmetic/motivational, not a combat system
- Not a general-purpose project management tool

## Target Users
- Single user (personal tool) — someone who wants gamification to stay on top of daily life

## Key Features
1. **Character** — Create a character with a class, name, level, XP, and gold
2. **Equipment** — Weapons, armor, and accessories that can be equipped; visual character sheet
3. **Daily Tasks** — Recurring tasks that reset daily; completion rewards XP/gold
4. **Personal Tasks** — One-off tasks with custom rewards
5. **Expense Tracker** — Log and complete expense entries; completing unlocks rewards
6. **Reward System** — XP, gold, and random item drops from completing tasks
7. **Leveling** — Accumulate XP to level up; stats grow and new equipment unlocks
8. **4Story UI Aesthetic** — Fantasy MMORPG styling: dark themed, medieval fonts, item tooltips, character sheet panel

## Success Criteria
- Completing any task awards XP/gold and triggers a visible reward animation
- Character sheet shows equipped items with stats
- Daily tasks reset at midnight
- Expense entries can be marked complete and contribute to character progression
- The UI feels authentically 4Story-inspired

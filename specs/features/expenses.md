# Feature: Expense Tracker

## Goal
Log real-world expenses and mark them as handled. Completing the tracking task rewards the character.

## Behavior
- User logs an expense: title, amount, category, optional notes, optional due date
- "Completing" an expense means the user has handled/reconciled it (paid it, recorded it, etc.)
- Completing awards XP and gold (smaller rewards than task completion — logging money is less effort)
- Deleted entries are permanently removed

## Expense Categories (suggested)
Food, Transport, Bills, Health, Entertainment, Shopping, Other

## UI
- Table or card list of expenses grouped by category or date
- Amount displayed prominently
- Completed entries greyed out
- Add expense form
- Mark complete button (triggers small reward animation)
- Running total of incomplete expenses

## Status: Backlog

# Feature: UI Theme (4Story Aesthetic)

## Goal
The entire UI should feel like a 4Story MMORPG interface — dark, fantasy, medieval.

## Visual Style
- **Color palette**: Deep dark backgrounds (`#0d0b0a`, `#1a1410`), gold accents (`#c8922a`, `#f0c060`), stone/parchment panels
- **Typography**: Medieval/fantasy serif font for headings (e.g. MedievalSharp, Cinzel), clean sans-serif for body
- **Borders**: Panel borders with corner ornaments, engraved/embossed look
- **Icons**: 4Story-style pixel art or hand-drawn item icons
- **Buttons**: Stone/metal texture, pressed state animation

## Key UI Components
- **Character Panel** — left sidebar with avatar silhouette, equipment slots arranged around the body (head, chest, legs, boots, weapon, offhand, accessory)
- **Item Tooltip** — appears on hover, shows item card with rarity-colored border, stats, lore text
- **XP Bar** — fantasy progress bar with glow effect, shows current/max XP
- **Gold Counter** — gold coin icon + number
- **Reward Popup** — animated overlay: "+50 XP", "+10 Gold", item card if dropped
- **Level-Up Banner** — full-width or centered overlay with dramatic animation

## Rarity Colors
| Rarity | Color |
|---|---|
| Common | `#9d9d9d` (gray) |
| Uncommon | `#1eff00` (green) |
| Rare | `#0070dd` (blue) |
| Epic | `#a335ee` (purple) |
| Legendary | `#ff8000` (orange) |

## Layout
- Top navigation: app name/logo, current character name + level badge
- Left sidebar: character panel
- Main content: active module (tasks, expenses)
- Responsive: sidebar collapses on small screens

## Status: Backlog
